# Developer Log

## Project Setup
- Initialized a new React application using Vite with the TypeScript template.
- Installed necessary dependencies: `react-router-dom` for routing, and `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` for styling.
- Configured Tailwind CSS by creating `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` and including the Tailwind directives in `src/index.css`.
- Organized the project structure by creating `components`, `hooks`, `pages`, and `types` directories within the `src` folder.

## Implementation Details

### `src/types/index.ts`
- Defined all necessary TypeScript types and interfaces (`Player`, `ChatMessage`, `GameState`, `WebSocketEvent`) as specified in the architectural blueprint. This ensures type safety across the application.

### `src/App.tsx`
- Set up the main application component with `react-router-dom`.
- Implemented routing for the `HomePage` (`/`) and `GameRoom` (`/game/:gameId`) components.

### `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`
- Created the landing page with functionality to create a new game or join an existing one.
- Used the `useNavigate` hook to redirect users to the appropriate game room.
- Included a placeholder for the API call to create a new game.

### `src/pages/GameRoom.tsx`
- Implemented the main game room component.
- It retrieves the `gameId` from the URL parameters.
- It utilizes the `useGameSocket` hook to manage all game-related state and communication.
- It renders the `PlayerList`, `ChatWindow`, and `MessageInput` components, passing the necessary data and functions as props.

### `src/hooks/useGameSocket.ts`
- This is the core of the frontend's real-time functionality.
- It establishes and manages the WebSocket connection.
- It uses a `useReducer` hook to handle all state transitions in a predictable manner, based on incoming WebSocket events.
- It exposes a clean interface (`gameState`, `sendMessage`) to the `GameRoom` component, abstracting away the complexities of WebSocket communication.

### `src/components/`
- **`PlayerList.tsx`**: A simple component to display the list of connected players.
- **`ChatWindow.tsx`**: A component to render the chat messages.
- **`MessageInput.tsx`**: A form component for typing and sending new messages.

## Key Decisions
- The implementation closely follows the architectural blueprint from `GEMINI.md`.
- The `useGameSocket` hook encapsulates all the complex logic, keeping the `GameRoom` component clean and presentational.
- The use of a reducer in the hook ensures that state updates are centralized and manageable.
- Placeholder values are used for `playerId` and `playerName` in `GameRoom.tsx`. In a real-world application, this would be replaced with a proper authentication and user management system.
- The API endpoint for creating a game in `HomePage.tsx` is hardcoded to `http://localhost:8000/games`. This would be configurable in a production environment.

## Debugging and Refinement
- **Symptom**: The application failed to compile, throwing a `SyntaxError` that a module did not provide an expected export (e.g., `Player`).
- **Diagnosis**: The issue was caused by how Vite's bundler handles TypeScript type-only imports. Although the syntax was correct, the bundler was incorrectly trying to treat type definitions as runtime JavaScript modules.
- **Resolution**: The fix was to convert all imports of TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `Player`, `ChatMessage`) to be explicit type-only imports using the `import type` syntax (e.g., `import type { Player } from '../types'`). This change was applied to `PlayerList.tsx`, `ChatWindow.tsx`, and `useGameSocket.ts`. This ensures the bundler correctly strips these imports during the build process, resolving the runtime error.
- **Bug Fix**: Corrected a syntax error in `MessageInput.tsx` where an extra character was present in the React import statement.
- **Bug Fix**: Refactored the `useGameSocket` hook to use a `useRef` to hold the WebSocket instance. The initial implementation incorrectly created a new WebSocket connection on every `sendMessage` call. The ref ensures a single, persistent connection is used for the component's lifecycle.
